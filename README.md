Easy, composable and transparent way to run things in a docker container.

## Transparently protect all your installs and script runs

Want to keep using the tools you're used to but get additional security?

Set up once, and every time you run `npm [anything]` it will run in a container.

### Quick Start

> You need docker installed in your system

```bash
# Install kipuka globally
npm install -g @lavamoat/kipuka

# Initialize configuration
kipuka-ctl init

# Set up shell aliases for package managers
kipuka-ctl alias
## or put `kipuka alias` at the end of your .bashrc
```

Now npm, yarn, pnpm run in docker containers


```
npm install
npm install --save-dev eslint
npm run build
npx create-next-app my-app
```


Kipuka lets you run any CLI tool in a containerized environment without polluting your host system or worrying about what that sketchy package is actually doing.

### Hardened alias

To use a more hardened version of the alias you can try:

```
kipuka-ctl alias --use=cli-hardened
```

The current version hsa a few tweaks, options to run offline and limit node permissions and uses `npq` instead of your package manager of choice. It's a work in progress.

### Start bash in kipuka in your current folder

```
kipuka
```

With custom options
```
kipuka -- --help
```

Run your own composition from `~/.kipuka/my.js`
```
kipuka my --help
```

### Clean up when you have too many

Run `kipuka-ctl cleanup` and it'll help you clean things up one by one.



## Commands

### `kipuka --`
Run the default kipuka environment.

### `kipuka <name>`
Run a custom kipuka defined in `~/.kipuka/<name>.js`.

### `kipuka-ctl init`
Initialize kipuka configuration directory at `~/.kipuka/` with:
- `kipuka.config.js` - Global configuration
- `example.js` - Example custom kipuka
- `package.json` - Node.js module configuration
- and more batterries-included useful compositions

### `kipuka-ctl alias`
Output and run shell aliases for package managers. 

You can put `kipuka-ctl alias` at the end of your .bashrc or copy its output for an immutable version.

### `kipuka-cli cleanup`
Interactively stop and remove selected kipuka containers and images. Keeps your Docker environment tidy.

## Configuration

Edit `~/.kipuka/kipuka.config.js` to customize:

```javascript
/** @type {KipukasGlobalConfig} */
export default {
  extensions: {
    // Extensions for all kipukas
    root: [withPackages(['vim', 'curl'])],
    user: [withEnv({ EDITOR: 'vim' })],
  },
  // Commands to alias to kipuka
  aliases: ['npm', 'npx', 'pnpm', 'pnpx', 'yarn', 'yarnpkg']
};
```

## Composing Your Own Kipuka

Create custom environments by composing components in `~/.kipuka/<name>.js`:

```javascript
import { kipuka, without, withDefaults, withPackages } from '@lavamoat/kipuka';

export default [
  ...without(kipuka, ["withDefaults"]),
  withDefaults({ name: "my-secure-env", from: "node:lts" }),
  withPackages(['git', 'vim', 'curl']),
  withEnv({ NODE_ENV: 'development' })
];
```

Run it with `kipuka <name>`

### Available Components

TBD, see components.js or let your IDE list what you can import

## How It Works

Kipuka creates isolated Docker containers for running CLI tools and development environments. Each kipuka is composed of reusable components that modify the Docker image and runtime configuration. When you run a command through kipuka, it:

1. Builds a custom Docker image based on your component composition
2. Mounts your current directory and relevant config files
3. Runs your command in the isolated container

Your files stay on the host, but the execution environment is isolated.
